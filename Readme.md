# Coding Interview Prep

A collection of coding interview problems, solutions, and notes to build pattern recognition and problem-solving skills.

## Structure

- **Problems**: Organized by pattern/topic (DP, Arrays, Trees, etc.)
- **Solutions**: Clean, commented code with explanations
- **Notes**: Pattern recognition guides, complexity analysis, and key insights
- **Reference**: Python syntax, common algorithms, and data structures

## How to Use

1. Attempt each problem independently
2. Review the solution and notes
3. Focus on understanding **why** solutions work, not just **how**
4. Build intuition by recognizing patterns across similar problems

## Slides that explain the problems as well
