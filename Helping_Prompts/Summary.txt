I solved the coding interview problem. Please provide a concise summary for my notes with the following sections:

1. Pattern Recognition
What algorithmic pattern/technique does this use? (e.g., two pointers, sliding window, hash map, DFS, etc.)
What are the key characteristics that indicate this pattern should be used?
What similar problems use this same pattern?

2. High-Level Approach
Describe the strategy in 2-3 sentences without code

3. Step-by-Step Logic
Break down the solution into clear logical steps (no code, just the thinking process)
Explain WHY each step works

4. Key Insights & Edge Cases
What makes this solution work?
Important implementation details or gotchas
Edge cases to handle

5. Pseudocode
High-level pseudocode structure (not actual code, just the logic flow)

6. Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(?) with brief explanation
Space Complexity: O(?) with brief explanation
Format: Use clear headers, bullet points for readability, and keep it concise. Focus on understanding and pattern recognition, not implementation details.

Here's my solution:
